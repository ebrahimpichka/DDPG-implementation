# DDPG-implementation
An implementation of the DDPG algorithm from the paper "Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning"


- A simple implementation of the paper **"Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning"** from **DeepMind** in python, using Pytorch framework.
- to train the agent and the deep Q network run `train.py`.
- the parameters of the Actor and Critic neural network and the agent could be set directly in `train.py`.
- models and result plots are saved in the corresponding directories.
